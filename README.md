# Adnalyzer
Adnalyzer is a program that can be used to optimize advertisements by analyzing the colours used in it. It will tell you the 2 most common used colours in the advertisement, and explain what these colours portray. For example, a brand like Whole Foods uses green in its logo and advertisements as much as possible, because it is proven that green evokes feelings of growth and health, while Cheerios use yellow to convey happiness.
\nFYI, the Processing GUI code is not functional, as it could not be completed in time for the hackathon deadline. To be continued!
